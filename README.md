=========

Repo to test some best-practices on relatively simple data and models.

Currently just consists of my following the Equinox tutorial. Nothing interesting to see yet.

# To Do

* Save metrics during training. Optionally using wandb.
* Break out evaluation functions into separate file.
* Checkpoint models during training.
* Tuning using optuna.
